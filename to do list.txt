how to pass information without using global variable? => how to add each page top different files
unable to back on modal barrier active 
ontapdown doesnt change to bop at the last remaining mishy of the level

unfollowed requirements:
3.	That the player can enter his/name if the score achieved is good enough to enter the Top 25 score table. (hard!)
question: do we enter before or after game ends? 

unresolved issues:
resolve timer issue where it is not actually 5 seconds => made it more accurate by setting precision to 0.1s

3.	That the player can enter his/name if the score achieved is good enough to enter the Top 25 score table. (hard!)
to do:
add name (can repeat) at leaderboard page load
=> change PK from name to (name, datetime)
=> load initial table
=> retrieve min score

if total score >= min score in top 25 table
=> add modal barrier
=> request name
=> insert record, sort, and reload top 25 table

if total score < min score in top 25 table
=> show score
=> add msg saying didnt make it into LeaderBoards
(no need to modify table in any way)
